# Fin Loader
Want a EXTREMELY easy multitool base (THAT ISNT FILLED WITH BLOAT), well use finloader (fl)!

All you have to do is install 2 files and you have the loader installed!

# What is the purpose
The purpose is to help you with a simple base for a multitool. All you have to do is add your tools, tell the program where your tools are, and done!

# How to install
Install **main.bat** and **vars.bat**.
You should probably make it a new folder. But you dont need to.

# How to make tools with it
1. DONT TOUCH MAIN.BAT!!! Its all ready for use, and all you have to do is set up **vars.bat**.
2. Make your tool in the same dir.
3. Setup **vars.bat**
### How to set up VARS.BAT
**FYI:** Theres only 3 spots for tools. Ill make it dynamic in the FULL version (coming out possibly in my lifetime)
1. Make your tool (it doesnt require any special code, the bat will just be ran)
2. Set the name in **vars.bat**. It should be T1NAME, T2NAME, or T3NAME (tool 1 name, tool 2 name, tool 3 name)
3. Set up the path to the dir with the tool(s) in **vars.bat**, with T1PATH, T2PATH, or T3PATH. It should be syntaxed like it would be used with **CD**. Like tools/ unlike "tools/".
4. Set up the filename to the tool in **vars.bat**. The var name is T1FILENAME, T2FILENAME, or T3FILENAME.
**(OPTIONAL)**: Setup the postmultitool var to whatever number you like.
